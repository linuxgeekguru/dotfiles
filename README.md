Prompt includes git additions while in a repository. Prompt colors change based on user and whether the system is local or remote. Green for regular users and red for root. Blue for local system and red for remote.

If you log into a remote system it will attempt to attach to or create a tmux session named default.

There are some aliases which are set for various uses and some which are modified based on the type of system. Example: provide color to ls which changes based on the system you are on.
